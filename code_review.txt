Concerns:
1. It would be better to indent more so it's easier to read.
2. The docstring for the count method could be more descriptive. Great job overall!

Response:
1. The nature of pythong usually means indenting more could create
extra problems and I wouldn't feel comfortable adding in ad hoc spacing
to a very fraught and overworked list of methods.
2. Count method docstring will be modified.
